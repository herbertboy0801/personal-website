## 2026-02-26 10:53 | L-Migration Phase 0-3 Complete + Deployment

### What was done
- Migrated from GitHub Pages + Express to Vercel + Turso architecture
- Created 7 Turso DB tables with indexes, migrated all data
- Built 7 Vercel Serverless Functions (merged from original 17 to fit Hobby plan)
- Updated all frontend pages to use fetch API instead of JS data files
- Updated admin panel API paths (morningJournal -> journal)
- Deployed to Vercel: https://personal-website-46pb.vercel.app/

### Key fixes during deployment
- Removed invalid `runtime: "@vercel/node@3"` from vercel.json
- Moved api/lib/ to lib/ (Vercel counted lib files as functions)
- Merged 4 auth endpoints into 1 api/auth.js (17 -> 7 functions)
- Added vercel.json rewrites for sub-routes (/api/blog/:id -> /api/blog?id=:id)
- Added manual .env.local parser to scripts (Node.js doesn't auto-load)
